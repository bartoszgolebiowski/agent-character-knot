            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Pierre attends the solemn religious service for his dying father, Count Bezúkhov. During the ceremony, he observes the varying reactions of those present, including the pious facade of Prince Vasíli and the laughter of the youngest princess, Sophie. Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess, Catiche, briefly leave the room for a private matter before returning. As the service concludes, the Count is moved from his chair to his bed, signaling his final moments.</p>
