            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Pierre Bezúkhov arrives in Moscow after being expelled from Petersburg for his riotous behavior. He is coldly received by his cousins, the three princesses, at his dying father&#39;s house. Prince Vasíli arrives and forbids Pierre from seeing the count. Borís Drubetskóy visits Pierre in his rooms, where Pierre, initially failing to recognize him, engages him in a conversation about Napoleon and the political climate, while Borís observes him with a sarcastic and detached air.</p>
