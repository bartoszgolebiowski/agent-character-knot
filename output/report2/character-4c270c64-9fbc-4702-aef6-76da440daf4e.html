Introduced as a man deeply bored by his social environment and his wife, seeking purpose in military service.
Andrew shows a willingness to support Pierre&#39;s unpopular views, highlighting his disdain for the superficiality of the other guests.
Andrew&#39;s duality is shown: he is cold and &#39;disagreeable&#39; to Hippolyte but &#39;gentle and affectionate&#39; toward Pierre.
Andrew&#39;s boredom with society is revealed to extend to his marriage; he treats his wife with a coldness that borders on cruelty, prioritizing his military ambitions over her emotional needs.
Andrew reveals a hidden layer of &#39;morbid irritation&#39; and intense regret regarding his marriage, contrasting with his usual lifeless social mask.

Andrew shows a lighter, almost playful side when dealing with his father&#39;s rigidness, contrasting with his coldness toward his wife.
