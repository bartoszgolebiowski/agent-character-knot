            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Prince Andrew, Pierre, and Princess Lise Bolkónskaya converse in Andrew&#39;s study. Lise expresses her fear and resentment regarding Andrew&#39;s departure for the war, accusing him of being an egotist and changing toward her. The interaction reveals a deep marital strain, with Andrew treating her with cold, formal politeness while Pierre watches with awkward discomfort. The chapter ends with Lise&#39;s emotional outburst subsiding into a piteous submission before she retires for the night.</p>
