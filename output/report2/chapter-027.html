            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>On the eve of his departure for war, Prince Andrew prepares his belongings and reflects on his future. He is interrupted by his sister, Princess Mary, who expresses her concern for his pregnant wife, Lise, and discusses their father&#39;s difficult temperament and religious views. Andrew remains cynical about his wife and their father&#39;s behavior, while Mary defends the old prince and shares her hopes for spiritual improvement.</p>
