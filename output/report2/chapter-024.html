            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The narrative shifts to Bald Hills, the estate of the retired General Prince Nicholas Bolkónski. The chapter establishes the rigid, disciplined routine of the household as they await the arrival of Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife. Prince Nicholas is depicted as a stern, exacting father who personally educates his daughter, Princess Mary, in mathematics to combat idleness and superstition. Mary, living in fear of her father&#39;s sharp temper, receives a letter from her friend Julie Karágina, which her father mockingly acknowledges before resuming a stressful geometry lesson.</p>
