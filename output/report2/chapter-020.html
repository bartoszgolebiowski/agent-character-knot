            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>As the Rostóvs&#39; party continues elsewhere, Count Bezúkhov suffers a sixth stroke, and his death is imminent. The Military Governor of Moscow visits to pay his respects, while the household prepares for the sacrament of unction. Prince Vasíli, visibly anxious about the inheritance, seeks a private meeting with the eldest princess, Catiche, to discuss business matters as the family and doctors wait for the end.</p>
