            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The religious service for the dying Count Bezúkhov takes place in his bedroom, attended by his family, doctors, and priests. Pierre observes the solemn ritual while the youngest princess, Sophie, finds his awkwardness amusing. During the service, Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess, Catiche, conduct a secretive meeting behind the bed, and the chapter ends with the physical effort of moving the dying Count from his chair to his bed.</p>
