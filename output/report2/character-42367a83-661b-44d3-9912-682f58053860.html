            <p><strong>First Appearance:</strong> <a href="chapter-001.html">CHAPTER II</a></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov; socially awkward and observant.</p>

            <p><strong>Evolution Summary:</strong> Illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov; socially awkward and observant.
Introduced as a &#39;stout&#39; and &#39;heavily built&#39; young man whose naturalness and lack of artifice make him a disruptive force in the rigid salon environment.
His deep admiration for Prince Andrew is revealed, showing he has a loyal and emotional nature despite his social clumsiness.
Pierre transitions from being merely socially awkward to being a source of genuine political scandal in the salon by defending Napoleon&#39;s most controversial acts.
Pierre&#39;s physical clumsiness and social ineptitude are fully displayed, yet his essential &#39;kindly&#39; nature earns him a reprieve from Anna Pávlovna.
Pierre&#39;s role as an &#39;outsider&#39; is emphasized as he witnesses the private dysfunction of the Bolkónski marriage, showing his inability to handle emotional confrontation.
Pierre&#39;s vulnerability is highlighted as he admits his shame over his illegitimacy and his total reliance on Andrew&#39;s perceived &#39;strength of will&#39;.
Pierre demonstrates a significant lack of character by immediately breaking a solemn promise to his mentor, Andrew. His physical strength is introduced as a &#39;Herculean&#39; trait that contrasts with his mental indecision.
His reputation has plummeted following the events at Anatole&#39;s, making him a subject of ridicule and pity in Moscow.
Pierre has moved from a disruptive guest in Petersburg to a social pariah in Moscow, retreating into political fantasies (imagining himself as Napoleon) while being controlled by Prince Vasíli.
Pierre makes his first social appearance in Moscow following his father&#39;s illness, immediately displaying his characteristic lack of grace.
Pierre has become almost entirely passive, allowing Anna Mikháylovna to lead him through his own father&#39;s house like a child.
Pierre remains a passive figure, more focused on observing the behavior of others than on his own emotional response to his father&#39;s death.
Pierre remains a bewildered witness to the violent greed of his relatives, following Anna Mikháylovna&#39;s lead without fully grasping the stakes.</p>
