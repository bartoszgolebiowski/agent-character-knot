            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Pierre Bezúkhov arrives in Moscow after being expelled from Petersburg for his scandalous behavior. He is coldly received by his cousins, the princesses, at his dying father&#39;s house. Prince Vasíli arrives and forbids Pierre from seeing the count. Later, Borís Drubetskóy visits Pierre to invite him to dinner at the Rostóvs&#39;, leading to a conversation where Pierre&#39;s social clumsiness and political obsessions are contrasted with Borís&#39;s cool, observant nature.</p>
