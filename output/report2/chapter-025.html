            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife, Lise, arrive at the Bolkónski estate, Bald Hills. They are greeted by the valet Tíkhon and later by Mademoiselle Bourienne and Princess Mary. The reunion is emotional for the women, who weep and embrace, while Prince Andrew remains detached and somewhat irritated by the display of emotion. Andrew confirms he is leaving for the war the following day, leaving Lise at the estate, which causes her further distress.</p>
