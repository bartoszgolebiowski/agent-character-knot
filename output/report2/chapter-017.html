            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>At the Rostóv house, guests await the arrival of the formidable Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova for dinner. In the Count&#39;s study, the men discuss the war manifesto while Shinshín ironically teases Lieutenant Berg about his self-centered financial ambitions and his transfer to the Guards. Pierre Bezúkhov arrives just as the guests prepare for dinner, appearing awkward in the drawing room.</p>
