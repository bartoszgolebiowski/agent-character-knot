            <p><strong>Evolution Summary:</strong> An elderly, influential courtier with a serene, flat face and a habit of speaking with indifferent irony.
Introduced as a seasoned courtier who navigates social circles with practiced indifference and refined manners.
His role as a father is introduced, showing him as part of a larger family unit within the Petersburg elite.
His pragmatic approach to social influence is highlighted, as is his susceptibility to guilt regarding past debts.
His Moscow persona is more overtly arrogant and protective of his interests compared to his behavior in Petersburg.
Vasíli has shifted from a serene courtier to a visibly stressed conspirator as the Count&#39;s death approaches.
His usual dignity is slipping into visible fear and impatience as the decisive moment of the Count&#39;s death nears.
Vasíli uses the cover of a religious service to continue his clandestine maneuvers with the eldest princess.
Vasíli&#39;s composure has completely broken down; he is now unable to control the women he was previously conspiring with.</p>

                        <p><strong>Context:</strong> During the religious service, they slip away to a back door together.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> They leave the service together for a private meeting behind the bed, reinforcing their shared agenda regarding the inheritance.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Causal Reasoning:</strong> This interaction confirms the persistence of their alliance as they take advantage of the service&#39;s distractions to coordinate.</p>
