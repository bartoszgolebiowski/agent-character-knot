            <p><strong>Evolution Summary:</strong> The pregnant wife of Prince Bolkónski, highly charming and popular in society.
Lise is shown to be an active participant in Anna Pávlovna&#39;s social engineering, contrasting with her husband&#39;s detachment.
Lise shifts from a charming socialite to a vulnerable, frightened wife who feels abandoned by her husband&#39;s lack of pity and his &#39;changed&#39; attitude.
Lise&#39;s transition to the country highlights her dependence on social stimulation and her growing dread of Andrew&#39;s departure.
Lise is visibly cowed by the old prince&#39;s presence, reacting to him with the &#39;fear and respect&#39; of a courtier before the Tsar.</p>
