            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Bolkónski family gathers for dinner at Bald Hills. The old prince demonstrates his eccentric egalitarianism by seating his architect, Michael Ivánovich, at the table. Prince Andrew mocks his father&#39;s obsession with the family genealogy to Princess Mary, while the old prince subjects Lise to his dry, cold humor regarding her pregnancy. The conversation shifts to the war, where the old prince dismisses Napoleon as an insignificant &#39;Frenchy&#39; and mocks modern military tactics, while Andrew respectfully engages his father&#39;s arguments about past generals like Suvórov.</p>
