# Chapter Analysis Task

You are analyzing a chapter from a literary work to extract characters, relationships, and significant events.

## Current Chapter Information

**Chapter {{ current_chapter_index + 1 }}**: {{ current_chapter_title }}

## Chapter Text

<chapter_text>
{{ current_chapter_text }}
</chapter_text>

{% if characters %}
## Known Characters (from previous chapters)

{% for char_id, profile in characters.items() %}
- **{{ profile.canonical_name }}** (ID: {{ char_id }})
  - Aliases: {{ profile.aliases | join(', ') if profile.aliases else 'None' }}
  - First appeared: Chapter {{ profile.first_appearance_chapter + 1 }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
## Known Characters

No characters discovered yet. This may be the first chapter.
{% endif %}

{% if events %}
## Previous Significant Events (for long-term reasoning)

{% for event in events[-10:] %}
- **Chapter {{ event.chapter_index + 1 }}**: {{ event.description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Your Task

Analyze the chapter text above and extract:

### 1. Entity Resolution (Characters)
- Identify all named characters mentioned in this chapter
- For each character, determine if they are:
  - A new character (not in the known characters list)
  - An existing character (match by name or alias)
  - An alias/reference to an existing character

### 2. Relationship Extraction
- Identify all significant relationships or interactions between characters
- For each relationship, provide:
  - The nature of the relationship (e.g., "Allies", "Enemies", "Family", "Romantic")
  - The reasoning explaining WHY this relationship exists
  - The context/circumstances of the interaction
  - A direct quote from the text as evidence

### 3. Event Extraction
- Identify major plot events that happen in this chapter
- Focus on events that:
  - Affect character relationships
  - Are referenced later in the story
  - Change the narrative direction
- For each event, note which characters are involved

### 4. Causal Links (Long-term Reasoning)
- If any current events reference or are caused by past events (from the list above), note the connection
- Explain the cause-and-effect relationship

## Important Guidelines

- Only extract real named characters, not generic mentions like "the crowd" or "soldiers"
- Quotes must be VERBATIM from the text - do not paraphrase
- Relationship types should be specific (e.g., "Secret Alliance" not just "Positive")
- Focus on quality over quantity - extract meaningful information only
