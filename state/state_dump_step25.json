    "current_chapter_text": "CHAPTER XII\n\nThe only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the\nyoung lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four\nyears older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),\nwere Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little\nbrunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long\nlashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny\ntint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but\ngraceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements,\nby the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain\ncoyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown\nkitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently\nconsidered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by\nsmiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes\nwatched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate\ngirlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose\nupon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to\nspring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as\nthey too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room.\n\n“Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and\npointing to Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and\nso for friendship’s sake he is leaving the university and me, his\nold father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a\nplace and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t\nthat friendship?” remarked the count in an inquiring tone.\n\n“But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor.\n\n“They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and\nthey’ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My\ndear, there’s friendship for you,” he repeated. “He’s joining\nthe hussars.”\n\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n\n“It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring\nup and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. “It is not from\nfriendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.”\n\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both\nregarding him with a smile of approbation.\n\n“Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us\ntoday. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.\nIt can’t be helped!” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and\nspeaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.\n\n“I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you\ndon’t wish to let me go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere\nexcept in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I\ndon’t know how to hide what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing\nwith the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sónya and the young\nlady visitor.\n\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment\nto start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n\n“All right, all right!” said the old count. “He always flares up!\nThis Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he\nrose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,” he\nadded, not noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile.\n\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to\nyoung Rostóv.\n\n“What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so\ndull without you,” said she, giving him a tender smile.\n\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish\nsmile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation\nwithout at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart\nof Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk\nhe glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and\nhardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile\non her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas’ animation\nvanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then\nwith a distressed face left the room to find Sónya.\n\n“How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their\nsleeves!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.\n“Cousinage—dangereux voisinage,” * she added.\n\n     * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\n\n“Yes,” said the countess when the brightness these young people had\nbrought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no\none had put but which was always in her mind, “and how much suffering,\nhow much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in\nthem now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is\nalways, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both\nfor girls and boys.”\n\n“It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor.\n\n“Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess. “Till now I\nhave always, thank God, been my children’s friend and had their full\nconfidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who\nimagine that their children have no secrets from them. “I know I shall\nalways be my daughters’ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with\nhis impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help it), he\nwill all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.”\n\n“Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the count,\nwho always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding\nthat everything was splendid. “Just fancy: wants to be an hussar.\nWhat’s one to do, my dear?”\n\n“What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor;\n“a little volcano!”\n\n“Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count. “Takes after me! And\nwhat a voice she has; though she’s my daughter, I tell the truth\nwhen I say she’ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an\nItalian to give her lessons.”\n\n“Isn’t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train\nit at that age.”\n\n“Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count. “Why, our\nmothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.”\n\n“And she’s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!” said the\ncountess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently\nconcerned with a thought that always occupied her: “Now you see if I\nwere to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they\nmight be up to on the sly” (she meant that they would be kissing),\n“but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to\nme of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I\nspoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I\nwas stricter.”\n\n“Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” remarked the handsome\nelder daughter, Countess Véra, with a smile.\n\nBut the smile did not enhance Véra’s beauty as smiles generally do;\non the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,\nexpression. Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at\nlearning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said\nwas true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone—the visitors\nand countess alike—turned to look at her as if wondering why she had\nsaid it, and they all felt awkward.\n\n“People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to\nmake something exceptional of them,” said the visitor.\n\n“What’s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too\nclever with Véra,” said the count. “Well, what of that? She’s\nturned out splendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra.\n\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.\n\n“What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the countess,\nwhen she had seen her guests out.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
