    "current_chapter_text": "CHAPTER X\n\nPrince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya\nwho had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of\nAnna Pávlovna’s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an\nexception made, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov\nGuards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment\nto Kutúzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and\nentreaties. Soon after Anna Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna\nreturned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the\nRostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling\nBóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being\nat once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from\nchildhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left\nPetersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in\nMoscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivílov.\n\nIt was St. Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the\nmother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly. Ever since\nthe morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going\ncontinually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on\nthe Povarskáya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and\nher handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors\nwho came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in\nrelays.\n\nThe countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type\nof face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve.\nA languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a\ndistinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna\nDrubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the\ndrawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young\npeople were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to\ntake part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw\nthem off, inviting them all to dinner.\n\n“I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he\ncalled everyone without exception and without the slightest variation\nin his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in\nrank—“I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name\nday we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended,\nma chère! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!”\nThese words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and\nwith the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the\nsame firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As\nsoon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were\nstill in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily\nspreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air\nof a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and\nfro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on\nquestions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but\nself-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in\nthe fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking\nhis scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.\nSometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the\nconservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables\nwere being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who\nwere bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask\ntable linen, he would call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and\nthe manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the\nenormous table would say: “Well, Dmítri, you’ll see that things are\nall as they should be? That’s right! The great thing is the serving,\nthat’s it.” And with a complacent sigh he would return to the\ndrawing room.\n\n“Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced the\ncountess’ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing\nroom. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold\nsnuffbox with her husband’s portrait on it.\n\n“I’m quite worn out by these callers. However, I’ll see her and\nno more. She is so affected. Ask her in,” she said to the footman in a\nsad voice, as if saying: “Very well, finish me off.”\n\nA tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling\ndaughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.\n\n“Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ...\nat the Razumóvski’s ball ... and Countess Apráksina ... I was\nso delighted...” came the sounds of animated feminine voices,\ninterrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and\nthe scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last\nout until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses\nand say, “I am so delighted... Mamma’s health... and Countess\nApráksina...” and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put\non cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief\ntopic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of\nCatherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate son\nPierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna’s\nreception.\n\n“I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor. “He is in\nsuch bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill\nhim!”\n\n“What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the\nvisitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of\nCount Bezúkhov’s distress some fifteen times.\n\n“That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor.\n“It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do\nas he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible\nthings that he has been expelled by the police.”\n\n“You don’t say so!” replied the countess.\n\n“He chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna.\n“Prince Vasíli’s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said,\nbeen up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.\nDólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent\nback to Moscow. Anatole Kurágin’s father managed somehow to get his\nson’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.”\n\n“But what have they been up to?” asked the countess.\n\n“They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,” replied the\nvisitor. “He is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy\nwoman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,\nput it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The\npolice tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied\na policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka\nCanal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his\nback!”\n\n“What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted\nthe count, dying with laughter.\n\n“Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”\n\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n\n“It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the\nvisitor. “And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son\nwho amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so\nwell educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has\ndone for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in\nspite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite\ndeclined: I have my daughters to consider.”\n\n“Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess,\nturning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.\n“His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is\nillegitimate.”\n\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n\n“I should think he has a score of them.”\n\nPrincess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently\nwishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in\nsociety.\n\n“The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a\nhalf whisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation.... He has\nlost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”\n\n“How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked the\ncountess. “I have never seen a handsomer man.”\n\n“He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as\nI was saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the\ncount is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to\nthe Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death—and he is\nso ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from\nPetersburg—no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre\nor Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know\nit all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides, Cyril\nVladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin. He’s also my Bóry’s\ngodfather,” she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the\nfact.\n\n“Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on\nsome inspection business,” remarked the visitor.\n\n“Yes, but between ourselves,” said the princess, “that is a\npretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich,\nhearing how ill he is.”\n\n“But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,” said the count;\nand seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the\nyoung ladies. “I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman\ncut!”\n\nAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form\nagain shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats\nwell and, in particular, drinks well. “So do come and dine with us!”\nhe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
