    "current_chapter_text": "CHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril\nVladímirovich Bezúkhov, Countess Rostóva sat for a long time all\nalone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.\n\n“What is the matter with you, my dear?” she said crossly to the maid\nwho kept her waiting some minutes. “Don’t you wish to serve me? Then\nI’ll find you another place.”\n\nThe countess was upset by her friend’s sorrow and humiliating poverty,\nand was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always\nfound expression in calling her maid “my dear” and speaking to her\nwith exaggerated politeness.\n\n“I am very sorry, ma’am,” answered the maid.\n\n“Ask the count to come to me.”\n\nThe count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as\nusual.\n\n“Well, little countess? What a sauté of game au madère we are to\nhave, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were\nnot ill-spent. He is worth it!”\n\nHe sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling\nhis gray hair.\n\n“What are your commands, little countess?”\n\n“You see, my dear... What’s that mess?” she said, pointing to his\nwaistcoat. “It’s the sauté, most likely,” she added with a smile.\n“Well, you see, Count, I want some money.”\n\nHer face became sad.\n\n“Oh, little countess!” ... and the count began bustling to get out\nhis pocketbook.\n\n“I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,” and taking\nout her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband’s waistcoat.\n\n“Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who’s there?” he called out\nin a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will\nrush to obey the summons. “Send Dmítri to me!”\n\nDmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count’s\nhouse and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.\n\n“This is what I want, my dear fellow,” said the count to the\ndeferential young man who had entered. “Bring me...” he reflected\na moment, “yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don’t\nbring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones\nfor the countess.”\n\n“Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,” said the countess, sighing\ndeeply.\n\n“When would you like them, your excellency?” asked Dmítri. “Allow\nme to inform you... But, don’t be uneasy,” he added, noticing that\nthe count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always\na sign of approaching anger. “I was forgetting... Do you wish it\nbrought at once?”\n\n“Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.”\n\n“What a treasure that Dmítri is,” added the count with a smile when\nthe young man had departed. “There is never any ‘impossible’ with\nhim. That’s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.”\n\n“Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,”\nsaid the countess. “But I am in great need of this sum.”\n\n“You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the\ncount, and having kissed his wife’s hand he went back to his study.\n\nWhen Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’s the money, all\nin clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’\nlittle table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating\nher.\n\n“Well, my dear?” asked the countess.\n\n“Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so\nill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...”\n\n“Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess\nbegan, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,\nelderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.\n\nAnna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be\nready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.\n\n“This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.”\n\nAnna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess\nwept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were\nkindhearted, and because they—friends from childhood—had to think\nabout such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....\nBut those tears were pleasant to them both.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
