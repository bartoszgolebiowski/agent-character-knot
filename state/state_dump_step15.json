    "current_chapter_text": "CHAPTER VII\n\nThe rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room. Prince\nAndrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it\nhad had in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from\nthe sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house\ndress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely\nplaced a chair for her.\n\n“How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly\nand fussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married?\nHow stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying\nso, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you\nare, Monsieur Pierre!”\n\n“And I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t understand why he\nwants to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess\nwith none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their\nintercourse with young women.\n\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the\nquick.\n\n“Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t\nunderstand it; I don’t in the least understand why men can’t live\nwithout wars. How is it that we women don’t want anything of the kind,\ndon’t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here\nhe is Uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so\nwell known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the\nApráksins’ I heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince\nAndrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed. “He is so well received\neverywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know\nthe Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of\nhow to arrange it. What do you think?”\n\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the\nconversation, gave no reply.\n\n“When are you starting?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken\nof,” said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which\nshe had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly\nill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.\n“Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations\nmust be broken off ... and then you know, André...” (she looked\nsignificantly at her husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she\nwhispered, and a shudder ran down her back.\n\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides\nPierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of\nfrigid politeness.\n\n“What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t understand,” said he.\n\n“There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim\nof his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone\nin the country.”\n\n“With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew gently.\n\n“Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to\nbe afraid.”\n\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a\njoyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she\nfelt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the\ngist of the matter lay in that.\n\n“I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said Prince\nAndrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.\n\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.\n\n“No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....”\n\n“Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew.\n“You had better go.”\n\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.\nPrince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.\n\nPierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and\nnow at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.\n\n“Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little\nprincess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful\ngrimace. “I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed\nso to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no\npity for me. Why is it?”\n\n“Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed\nan entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself\nregret her words. But she went on hurriedly:\n\n“You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave\nlike that six months ago?”\n\n“Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more\nemphatically.\n\nPierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to\nall this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the\nsight of tears and was ready to cry himself.\n\n“Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you\nI myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me!\nAn outsider is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself....\nGood-by!”\n\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand.\n\n“No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of\nthe pleasure of spending the evening with you.”\n\n“No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without\nrestraining her angry tears.\n\n“Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch\nwhich indicates that patience is exhausted.\n\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty\nface changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes\nglanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid,\ndeprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its\ndrooping tail.\n\n“Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she muttered, and lifting her dress with one\nhand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.\n\n“Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand\nas he would have done to a stranger.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
