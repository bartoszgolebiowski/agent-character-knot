    "current_chapter_text": "CHAPTER XXVIII\n\nPrince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering\nhis routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in\nher sister-in-law’s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without\nepaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.\nAfter inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he\nordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept\nwith him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted\nwith silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber—a present from\nhis father who had brought it from the siege of Ochákov. All these\ntraveling effects of Prince Andrew’s were in very good order: new,\nclean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.\n\nWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable\nof reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments\none reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew’s face\nlooked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced\nbriskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him\nand thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was\nhe sad at leaving his wife?—perhaps both, but evidently he did not\nwish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he\nhurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the\ncover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable\nexpression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.\n\n“I hear you have given orders to harness,” she cried, panting (she\nhad apparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk\nwith you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not\nangry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,” she added,\nas if to explain such a question.\n\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was\nobviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be\nAndrúsha—the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in\nchildhood.\n\n“And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a\nsmile.\n\n“She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.\nOh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she, sitting\ndown on the sofa, facing her brother. “She is quite a child: such a\ndear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.”\n\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and\ncontemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n\n“One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,\nAndrew? Don’t forget that she has grown up and been educated in\nsociety, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into\neveryone’s situation. Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner. * Think\nwhat it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,\nto be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her\ncondition! It’s very hard.”\n\n     * To understand all is to forgive all.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we\nthink we thoroughly understand.\n\n“You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he\nreplied.\n\n“I... that’s different. Why speak of me? I don’t want any other\nlife, and can’t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young\nsociety woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her\nlife, all alone—for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what\npoor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.\nThere is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....”\n\n“I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,” said Prince\nAndrew.\n\n“No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be\npitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don’t need her,\nand she’s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am\neven more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and\nMichael Ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and\nkind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says:\n‘We don’t love people so much for the good they have done us, as\nfor the good we have done them.’ Father took her when she was homeless\nafter losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father\nlikes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads\nsplendidly.”\n\n“To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father’s character sometimes\nmakes things trying for you, doesn’t it?” Prince Andrew asked\nsuddenly.\n\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n\n“For me? For me?... Trying for me!...” said she.\n\n“He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting\nvery trying,” said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their\nfather in order to puzzle or test his sister.\n\n“You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of\nintellectual pride,” said the princess, following the train of her own\nthoughts rather than the trend of the conversation—“and that’s a\ngreat sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling\nexcept veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so\ncontented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I\nam.”\n\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n\n“The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,\nAndrew... is Father’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t\nunderstand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is\nas clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing\nthat makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of\nimprovement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a\nmonk he received and had a long talk with.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your\npowder,” said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n\n“Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.\nAndrew...” she said timidly after a moment’s silence, “I have a\ngreat favor to ask of you.”\n\n“What is it, dear?”\n\n“No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble\nand is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,\nAndrúsha!...” said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet\ntaking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were\nthe subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was\ngranted.\n\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n\n“Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince Andrew,\nas if guessing what it was about.\n\n“Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as\nyou please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father’s father, our\ngrandfather, wore it in all his wars.” (She still did not take out\nwhat she was holding in her reticule.) “So you promise?”\n\n“Of course. What is it?”\n\n“Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will\nnever take it off. Do you promise?”\n\n“If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won’t break my neck...\nTo please you...” said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing\nthe pained expression his joke had brought to his sister’s face, he\nrepented and added: “I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.”\n\n“Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you\nto Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a voice\ntrembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her\nbrother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold\nsetting, on a finely wrought silver chain.\n\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n\n“Please, Andrew, for my sake!...”\n\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit\nup the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother\nwould have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,\ncrossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for\nhe was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.\n\n“Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat down\nagain on the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n\n“As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always\nused to be. Don’t judge Lise harshly,” she began. “She is so\nsweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.”\n\n“I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed\nher. Why do you say all this to me?”\n\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary’s face and she was silent as if\nshe felt guilty.\n\n“I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And\nI am sorry for that,” he went on.\n\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to\nsay something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little\nprincess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings\nabout her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her\nfate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen\nasleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n\n“Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and never\nshall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself\nwith anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever\ncircumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if\nyou want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this\nis so I don’t know...”\n\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed\nher forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and\nunaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over\nher head toward the darkness of the open doorway.\n\n“Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or—go and wake and I’ll\ncome in a moment. Petrúshka!” he called to his valet: “Come here,\ntake these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.”\n\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:\n“Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him\nto give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been\nanswered.”\n\n“Well, maybe!” said Prince Andrew. “Go, Másha; I’ll come\nimmediately.”\n\nOn the way to his sister’s room, in the passage which connected one\nwing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling\nsweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and\nartless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.\n\n“Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason\nblushing and dropping her eyes.\n\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly\ncame over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead\nand hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the\nFrenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his\nsister’s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying\none word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as\nusual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make\nup for lost time.\n\n“No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and her\nmouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....\nHa, ha, ha! Mary!”\n\nThis very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince\nAndrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some\nfive times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and\nrosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking\nincessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince\nAndrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after\ntheir journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.\n\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn\nnight, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.\nServants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense\nhouse was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The\ndomestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to\nthe young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the\nreception hall: Michael Ivánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess\nMary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his\nfather’s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All\nwere waiting for them to come out.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age\nspectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his\nson, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.\n\n“Going?” And he went on writing.\n\n“I’ve come to say good-by.”\n\n“Kiss me here,” and he touched his cheek: “Thanks, thanks!”\n\n“What do you thank me for?”\n\n“For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman’s apron strings.\nThe Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!” And he went on\nwriting, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. “If you have\nanything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,” he\nadded.\n\n“About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your\nhands....”\n\n“Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.”\n\n“When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let\nhim be here....”\n\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his\nstern eyes on his son.\n\n“I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,” said\nPrince Andrew, evidently confused. “I know that out of a million\ncases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been\ntelling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.”\n\n“Hm... Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he\nwas writing. “I’ll do it.”\n\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to\nlaugh.\n\n“It’s a bad business, eh?”\n\n“What is bad, Father?”\n\n“The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n\n“I don’t understand!” said Prince Andrew.\n\n“No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince. “They’re\nall like that; one can’t unmarry. Don’t be afraid; I won’t tell\nanyone, but you know it yourself.”\n\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked\nstraight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to see\nthrough him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The\nold man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing\ndown the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.\n\n“What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything. Make your\nmind easy,” said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.\n\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father\nunderstood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.\n\n“Listen!” said he; “don’t worry about your wife: what can be\ndone shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich. *\nI have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not\nkeep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember\nand like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all\nright—serve him. Nicholas Bolkónski’s son need not serve under\nanyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.”\n\n     *Kutúzov.\n\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son\nwas accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the\nlid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his\nbold, tall, close handwriting.\n\n“I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;\nhand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond\nand a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of\nSuvórov’s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for\nyou to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.”\n\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time\nyet. He felt that he must not say it.\n\n“I will do it all, Father,” he said.\n\n“Well, now, good-by!” He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced\nhim. “Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,\nyour old father...” he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous\nvoice suddenly shrieked: “but if I hear that you have not behaved like\na son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!”\n\n“You need not have said that to me, Father,” said the son with a\nsmile.\n\nThe old man was silent.\n\n“I also wanted to ask you,” continued Prince Andrew, “if I’m\nkilled and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you—as I\nsaid yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.”\n\n“Not let the wife have him?” said the old man, and laughed.\n\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The old man’s sharp eyes were\nfixed straight on his son’s. Something twitched in the lower part of\nthe old prince’s face.\n\n“We’ve said good-by. Go!” he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry\nvoice, opening his door.\n\n“What is it? What?” asked both princesses when they saw for a moment\nat the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white\ndressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply.\n\n“Well!” he said, turning to his wife.\n\nAnd this “Well!” sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: “Now\ngo through your performance.”\n\n“Andrew, already!” said the little princess, turning pale and\nlooking with dismay at her husband.\n\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.\n\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,\nand carefully placed her in an easy chair.\n\n“Adieu, Mary,” said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand\nand kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.\n\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing\nher temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked\nwith her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince\nAndrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From\nthe study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man\nangrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study\ndoor opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white\ndressing gown looked out.\n\n“Gone? That’s all right!” said he; and looking angrily at the\nunconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed\nthe door.\n\n\n\n\n",

His physical strength is introduced as a 'Herculean' trait that contrasts with his mental indecision.\nHis reputation has plummeted following the events at Anatole's, making him a subject of ridicule and pity in Moscow.\nPierre has moved from a disruptive guest in Petersburg to a social pariah in Moscow, retreating into political fantasies (imagining himself as Napoleon) while being controlled by Prince Vasíli.\nPierre makes his first social appearance in Moscow following his father's illness, immediately displaying his characteristic lack of grace.\nPierre has become almost entirely passive, allowing Anna Mikháylovna to lead him through his own father's house like a child.\nPierre remains a passive figure, more focused on observing the behavior of others than on his own emotional response to his father's death.\nPierre remains a bewildered witness to the violent greed of his relatives, following Anna Mikháylovna's lead without fully grasping the stakes.",

        "summary": "In July 1805, the St. Petersburg and Moscow aristocracies are preoccupied with the looming war against Napoleon and the impending death of the wealthy Count Bezúkhov. At Anna Pávlovna Schérer’s soirée, the socially awkward Pierre Bezúkhov and the disillusioned Prince Andrew Bolkónski emerge as central figures; Andrew decides to leave his pregnant wife, Lise, to serve as an aide-de-camp to General Kutúzov. Meanwhile, in Moscow, the vibrant Rostóv family celebrates a name day, highlighting the youthful romances of Natásha and Borís, and Nicholas and Sónya, before the young men depart for military service. The narrative arc is defined by the contrast between the rigid social maneuvering of Prince Vasíli and Anna Mikháylovna and the authentic, albeit chaotic, search for purpose by Pierre and Andrew. As Count Bezúkhov nears death, the struggle for his inheritance begins, while the younger generation is thrust from domestic stability into the uncertainty of the Napoleonic Wars."
