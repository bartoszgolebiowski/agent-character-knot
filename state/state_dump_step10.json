    "current_chapter_text": "CHAPTER V\n\n“And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at\nMilan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of\nGenoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and\nMonsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of\nthe nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as\nif the whole world had gone crazy.”\n\nPrince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a\nsarcastic smile.\n\n“‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say he was\nvery fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in\nItalian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’\n\n     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!\n\n“I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run\nover,” Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to\nendure this man who is a menace to everything.”\n\n“The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite\nbut hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis\nXVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became\nmore animated. “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their\nbetrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending\nambassadors to compliment the usurper.”\n\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time\nthrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the\nlittle princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé\ncoat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity\nas if she had asked him to do it.\n\n“Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,”\nsaid he.\n\nThe princess listened, smiling.\n\n“If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the\nvicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which\nhe is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but\nfollows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too\nfar. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I\nmean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and\nthen....”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to\nmake a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna,\nwho had him under observation, interrupted:\n\n“The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which\nalways accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has\ndeclared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose\ntheir own form of government; and I believe that once free from the\nusurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms\nof its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the\nroyalist emigrant.\n\n“That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le Vicomte quite\nrightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will\nbe difficult to return to the old regime.”\n\n“From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into\nthe conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\nBonaparte’s side.”\n\n“It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without\nlooking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the\nreal state of French public opinion.”\n\n“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic\nsmile.\n\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his\nremarks at him, though without looking at him.\n\n“‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow\nit,’” Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting\nNapoleon’s words. “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded\nin.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”\n\n“Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the\nduc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some\npeople,” he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,\nafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one\nhero less on earth.”\n\nBefore Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their\nappreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the\nconversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something\ninappropriate, she was unable to stop him.\n\n“The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre,\n“was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon\nshowed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole\nresponsibility of that deed.”\n\n“Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.\n\n“What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows\ngreatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her\nwork nearer to her.\n\n“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.\n\n“Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his\nknee with the palm of his hand.\n\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his\naudience over his spectacles and continued.\n\n“I say so,” he continued desperately, “because the Bourbons fled\nfrom the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone\nunderstood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,\nhe could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”\n\n“Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna\nPávlovna.\n\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n\n“No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “Napoleon is great\nbecause he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,\npreserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom\nof speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain\npower.”\n\n“Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to\ncommit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have\ncalled him a great man,” remarked the vicomte.\n\n“He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might\nrid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great\nman. The Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur Pierre,\nbetraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme\nyouth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.\n\n“What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...\nBut won’t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna.\n\n“Rousseau’s Contrat Social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant\nsmile.\n\n“I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.”\n\n“Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an\nironical voice.\n\n“Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most\nimportant. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from\nprejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon\nhas retained in full force.”\n\n“Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at\nlast deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words\nwere, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does\nnot love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and\nequality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the\ncontrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”\n\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the\nvicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of\nPierre’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was\nhorror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words\nhad not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was\nimpossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in\na vigorous attack on the orator.\n\n“But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the\nfact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is\ninnocent and untried?”\n\n“I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains\nthe 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not\nat all like the conduct of a great man!”\n\n“And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the\nlittle princess, shrugging her shoulders.\n\n“He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince Hippolyte.\n\nPierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His\nsmile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,\nhis grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by\nanother—a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to\nask forgiveness.\n\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that\nthis young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were\nsilent.\n\n“How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince\nAndrew. “Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish\nbetween his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.\nSo it seems to me.”\n\n“Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of\nthis reinforcement.\n\n“One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man\nwas great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he\ngave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts\nwhich it is difficult to justify.”\n\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of\nPierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to\ngo.\n\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,\nand asking them all to be seated began:\n\n“I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.\nExcuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be\nlost....” And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian\nas a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.\nEveryone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their\nattention to his story.\n\n“There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must\nhave two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her\ntaste. And she had a lady’s maid, also big. She said....”\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with\ndifficulty.\n\n“She said.... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a\nlivery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some\ncalls.’”\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his\naudience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several\npersons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however\nsmile.\n\n“She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and\nher long hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no\nlonger and went on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world\nknew....”\n\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told\nit, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the\nothers appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably\nending Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote\nthe conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last\nand next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and\nwhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
